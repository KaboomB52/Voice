# Voice
The most basic Voice Channel plugin for CheatBreaker.

## What does this do?
This does the exact same thing as the "voice.protocol.rip" server, which is to make a voice channel of which everyone joins when they join the server and which everyone leaves when they leave the server.

## What Client does this work with?
This works with any CheatBreaker with a voice chat server, This was created for use with Protocol's CheatBreaker but can be used for any.

## Compiling
Simply replace the sourspigot dependency with your own spigot (server) and it will work, I am providing the Offical CheatBreakerAPI however you can use a custom one as long as it has Voice Chat in it.
